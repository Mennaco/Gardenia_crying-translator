Our graduation project GARDENIA built to help new mothers to care about their babies 
my part was about their crying (crying translator)
that subsystem was to analyse baby's crying and predict why he is crying 
it consists of two models 

the first predicts if the sound is crying or not 
if yse the second predicts the reason 
try these models and enjoy
